All coefficients (\\( a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3 \\)) are positive.\n\n2. **Analyze the Behavior of \\( P(y) \\):**\n   - As \\( y \\to \\infty \\), the term \\( -a_3 y^3 \\) dominates, making \\( P(y) \\to -\\infty \\).\n   - As \\( y \\to -\\infty \\), the term \\( -a_3 y^3 = a_3 |y|^3 \\) (since \\( y \\) is negative) dominates, so \\( P(y) \\to +\\infty \\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\( P(0) \\):**\n   Substituting \\( y = 0 \\), we get \\( P(0) = a_0 > 0 \\). Thus, the function crosses the y-axis above zero.\n\n4. **Determine Monotonicity:**\n   - Compute the derivative \\( P'(y) = -3a_3 y^2 + 2a_2 y - a_1 \\).\n   - Since all coefficients are positive, the derivative is a quadratic opening downward (because of the negative coefficient on \\( y^2 \\)).\n   - The derivative may have two real roots, indicating critical points where the function changes direction.\n\n5. **Apply Descartes' Rule of Signs:**\n   - For \\( P(y) = 0 \\), there are three sign changes in the coefficients (from \\( +a_0 \\) to \\( -a_1 y \\) to \\( +a_2 y^2 \\) to \\( -a_3 y^3 \\)), suggesting up to three positive real roots.\n   - However, since all coefficients are positive and the leading term is negative, the function tends to \\( -\\infty \\) as \\( y \\to \\infty \\), limiting the number of positive roots.\n\n6. **Use the Intermediate Value Theorem:**\n   - Since \\( P(0) = a_0 > 0 \\) and \\( P(y) \\to -\\infty \\) as \\( y \\to \\infty \\), there must be at least one real root in \\( (0, \\infty) \\).\n   - Given the behavior of cubic functions and the derivative's nature, this is the only positive real root.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   The equation has exactly one real positive solution for \\( y \\).\n\n**Final Answer:** The equation has exactly one real positive solution."}

{"task_id": "CPP/59", "generation": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a C++ function called largest_prime_factor that takes an integer n and returns its largest prime factor. The user provided a Python solution as an example, so I should base my C++ code on that.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the Python code does. It starts by checking if n is less than or equal to 1, returning None in that case. Then it initializes 'largest' to -1. It handles even numbers by dividing n by 2 until it's no longer divisible, updating 'largest' if 2 is a factor. Next, it checks for odd factors starting from 3 up to the square root of n. For each odd i, it divides n as long as possible and updates 'largest' when a larger prime is found. Finally, if after processing all factors, n is still greater than 1, it's considered a prime factor itself.\n\nSo, for the C++ function:\n\n1. **Handle edge cases**: If n <= 1, return -1 or some indication of failure since primes are greater than 1.\n2. **Check divisibility by 2**: Use a loop to divide n by 2 until it's odd, updating the largest factor if 2 is found.\n3. **Check for odd factors**: Loop from i=3 to sqrt(n), incrementing by 2 each time. For each i, check if it divides n and update the largest factor accordingly.\n4. **Final check**: If after processing all possible factors, n is still greater than 1, it means n itself is the largest prime factor.\n\nI should also consider how to compute the square root in C++. Using sqrt() from <math.h> is an option, but since we're dealing with integers, maybe a loop until i*i exceeds n would be more efficient and avoid including math.h.\n\nWait, including math.h might not be necessary if I use a while loop. So perhaps I can compute the square root iteratively to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n- Initialize 'largest' as -1.\n- If n is even, divide by 2 until it's odd and set largest to 2 if applicable.\n- Loop i from 3 to sqrt(n), step 2:\n   - While i divides n, update largest if i is larger than current largest and divide n by i.\n- After the loop, if n > 1, check if it's larger than 'largest' and set accordingly.\n\nI should also test some examples. For instance, for n=13195, the function should return 29. Let me see how the code would handle that:\n\nn starts as 13195.\nDivide by 2: 13195 is odd, so no change.\nCheck i from 3 to sqrt(13195) which is around 115.\ni=3: 13195 /3 = 4399.666... not divisible.\ni=5: Ends with 5, but 13195/5=2639, which is exact. So largest becomes 5, n becomes 2639.\nContinue checking i up to sqrt(2639) ~51.\ni=7: 2639 /7 \u2248377. So divide by 7, n=377, largest=7.\nNext i=9: Not divisible.\ni=11: 377/11\u224834.27, not exact.\n...\nContinue until i=29: 377 /29 =13, so n becomes 13, and largest is updated to 29.\nNow, since sqrt(13) is ~3.6, the loop ends. Then check if n>1 (13>1), so set largest to 13? Wait, but in the Python code, after processing all factors up to sqrt(n), if n >1, it's considered a prime factor.\n\nWait, no. In the Python code, after dividing by 2 and odd factors up to sqrt(n), if n is still greater than 1, it means n itself is a prime number and should be compared with 'largest'. So in this case, after processing i=29, n becomes 13, which is greater than 1. Since 13 >29? No, 13<29. So the largest remains 29.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the function returns 29 for 13195, which is correct because 13195 = 5 \u00d7 2639, and 2639=7\u00d7377, and 377=13\u00d729. So the prime factors are 5,7,13,29, with 29 being the largest.\n\nSo in the code, after processing i up to sqrt(n), if n>1, it's a prime factor. But in this case, n becomes 13, which is less than the current 'largest' (29). So no change.\n\nAnother example: n=2048. It's even, so divide by 2 until n becomes 1. The largest would be 2.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, writing the C++ function:\n\n- Include necessary headers.\n- Function signature: int largest_prime_factor(int n)\n- Handle edge case: if n <=1, return -1 or something. But according to the problem statement, assume n>1, but better to include it for robustness.\n- Initialize 'largest' as 0? Or start with -1 and update when necessary.\n\nWait, in C++, initializing 'largest' as -1 might cause issues if all factors are larger than that. So perhaps initialize it as 0 or a smaller number.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, n is assumed to be valid, but better to handle cases where no factors are found (n=1).\n\nSo:\n\nint largest_prime_factor(int n) {\n    if (n <= 1) return -1; // Or handle accordingly\n    int largest = -1;\n    // Check for divisibility by 2\n    while (n % 2 == 0) {\n        largest = 2;\n        n /= 2;\n    }\n    // Now check odd factors up to sqrt(n)\n    for (int i=3; i*i <=n; i +=2) {\n        while (n%i ==0) {\n            if (i > largest) {\n                largest = i;\n            }\n            n /=i;\n        }\n    }\n    // If remaining n is a prime\n    if (n >1) {\n        if (n > largest) {\n            largest = n;\n        }\n    }\n    return largest;\n}\n\nWait, but in the code above, when checking for factors, after dividing by i as much as possible, we set 'largest' to the maximum between current 'largest' and i. But what if a larger factor exists later? For example, suppose n=15: 3*5.\n\nIn the loop:\n\ni=3: divides once, largest becomes 3, n becomes5.\nLoop continues since i*i (9) >n(5), so loop ends.\nThen check if n>1: yes, 5>3, so largest becomes5. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=21=3*7.\n\ni=3: divides once, largest=3, n=7.\nLoop condition: i*i=9 <=7? No, because i starts at3, next i is5, but 5^2=25>7. So loop ends.\nThen check if n>1 (7>1), so set largest to7.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTesting with n=12:\n\nn=12: even, divide by2 twice, largest=2, n=3.\nLoop i from3: 3^2=9 <=3? No. So loop doesn't run.\nCheck if n>1 (yes), set largest to3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=49=7*7.\n\nn is odd, so no division by2.\ni starts at3: 3^2=9<=49 yes.\nCheck 49%3 !=0.\nNext i=5: 25 <=49, 49%5=4, no.\ni=7: 49%7==0. So enter loop:\ndivide by7 once, largest becomes7, n=7.\nAgain, 7%7==0, divide again, largest remains7, n=1.\nLoop continues until i*i >n (now n is1). So after the loop, check if n>1? No.\n\nSo function returns7. Correct.\n\nAnother test: n=35=5*7.\n\ni starts at3: 35%3 !=0.\ni=5: 35%5==0. Divide once, largest=5, n=7.\nLoop continues since i=5, next i=7. But 7^2=49>7? No, because after dividing by5, n is7. So loop runs for i=3,5,7.\n\nWait, in the code, after processing i=5, n becomes7. Then i increments to7. Now, i*i=49 <=n=7? 49<=7 is false, so loop ends.\nThen check if n>1: yes, 7>5, so largest becomes7. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, in C++, I need to include <math.h> for sqrt(), but since we're using i*i <=n, which is integer-based, perhaps it's better to avoid including math.h and just use a while loop with i*i <=n.\n\nAlternatively, compute sqrt(n) as an integer.\n\nBut for the code above, the square root is computed as i*i <=n. So no need for math.h.\n\nSo the final code would be:\n\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint largest_prime_factor(int n) {\n    if (n <= 1) return -1; // Handle invalid input\n    int largest = -1;\n    // Check divisibility by 2\n    while (n % 2 == 0) {\n        largest = 2;\n        n /= 2;\n    }\n    // Check for odd factors up to sqrt(n)\n    for (int i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2) {\n        while (n % i == 0) {\n            if (i > largest) {\n                largest = i;\n            }\n            n /= i;\n        }\n    }\n    // If remaining n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if (n > 1 && n > largest) {\n        largest = n;\n    }\n    return largest;\n}\n\n"}

{"task_id": "CPP/81", "generation": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a C++ function called numerical_letter_grade that takes a vector of floats (grades) and returns a vector of strings representing the corresponding letter grades based on the given table. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grading criteria. The table shows different GPA ranges and their corresponding letter grades. For example, 4.0 is an A+, anything above 3.7 but below 4.0 is an A, and so on down to 0.0 being an E.\n\nSo, my function needs to iterate through each grade in the input vector and determine which letter it falls into. I'll probably need a series of if-else statements or some kind of lookup structure to map the GPA ranges to their respective letters.\n\nWait, but using multiple if-else conditions might be more straightforward here since there are only a few cases. Alternatively, I could create a list of thresholds and corresponding grades, then check each grade against these thresholds in order.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the grades? Wait, no, because the input is a vector of floats, but the problem doesn't specify any particular order. So I don't need to sort them; each grade will be processed individually.\n\n2. For each grade, determine which letter it belongs to based on the given criteria.\n\nLet me list out all the conditions:\n\n- If GPA is exactly 4.0: A+\n- If GPA >3.7 and <=4.0: A\n- If GPA>3.3 and <=3.7: A-\n- If GPA>3.0 and <=3.3: B+\n- If GPA>2.7 and <=3.0: B\n- If GPA>2.3 and <=2.7: B-\n- If GPA>2.0 and <=2.3: C+\n- If GPA>1.7 and <=2.0: C\n- If GPA>1.3 and <=1.7: C-\n- If GPA>1.0 and <=1.3: D+\n- If GPA>0.7 and <=1.0: D\n- If GPA>0.0 and <=0.7: D-\n- If GPA is exactly 0.0: E\n\nWait, but the table shows that 4.0 is A+, then >3.7 is A, which implies up to but not including 3.7? Or does it include 3.7? Let me check the original problem statement.\n\nLooking back, the table says:\n\n- 4.0: A+\n- >3.7: A\n- >3.3: A-\nAnd so on. So each condition is strictly greater than the lower bound and less than or equal to the upper bound except for the highest ones which are exact.\n\nWait, no. For example, 4.0 is exactly A+, then anything above 3.7 but up to (but not including) 4.0 is A. Then anything above 3.3 but up to 3.7 is A-. So each condition is inclusive of the upper bound and exclusive of the lower.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The way it's written:\n\n- GPA 4.0 is A+\n- >3.7: so grades higher than 3.7 (but less than 4.0) are A\n- >3.3: so grades higher than 3.3 but up to 3.7 are A-\nAnd so on.\n\nSo for each grade, I need to check in descending order starting from the highest threshold and see where it fits.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a list of pairs where each pair is (threshold, letter), ordered from highest to lowest. For each grade, I'll iterate through these pairs and return the first letter where the grade is greater than or equal to the threshold.\n\nWait, but for 4.0, it's an exact match, so perhaps I should handle that first.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this in code.\n\nI can create a vector of pairs, each containing a double (the threshold) and a string (the letter). The vector will be ordered from highest to lowest thresholds.\n\nFor example:\n\nvector<pair<double, string>> thresholds = {\n    {4.0, \"A+\"},\n    {3.7, \"A\"},\n    {3.3, \"A-\"},\n    {3.0, \"B+\"},\n    {2.7, \"B\"},\n    {2.3, \"B-\"},\n    {2.0, \"C+\"},\n    {1.7, \"C\"},\n    {1.3, \"C-\"},\n    {1.0, \"D+\"},\n    {0.7, \"D\"},\n    {0.0, \"D-\"},\n    {0.0, \"E\"} // Wait, but 0.0 is E regardless of the threshold.\n};\n\nWait, no. The last condition is GPA=0.0 is E. So perhaps I should handle that after all others.\n\nAlternatively, since 0.0 is the lowest, it's better to check if the grade is exactly 0.0 and assign E.\n\nBut in code, how do I handle this? Because for a grade of 0.0, it will fall into the last condition before E, which is D- (if GPA>0.7). Wait no: the thresholds are:\n\nLooking back, after 1.0, the next threshold is 0.7 for D, then 0.0 for D-, but wait, in the problem statement, it's:\n\n>0.0: D-\nBut also, 0.0 is E.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the table:\n\nThe table shows:\n\n- 4.0: A+\n- >3.7: A\n- >3.3: A-\n- >3.0: B+\n- >2.7: B\n- >2.3: B-\n- >2.0: C+\n- >1.7: C\n- >1.3: C-\n- >1.0: D+ \n- >0.7: D \n- >0.0: D-\n- 0.0: E\n\nSo, for a grade of exactly 0.0, it's E.\n\nFor grades between 0.0 and 0.7 (not including 0.0), they are D- if above 0.0 but <=0.7? Wait no:\n\nWait the table says:\n\n>0.0: D-\nSo any grade greater than 0.0 is D-, but wait, that can't be right because then grades between 0.0 and 0.7 would all be D-.\n\nBut looking back, the problem statement shows:\n\nThe last row before E is:\n\n>0.0: D-\n\nAnd then 0.0: E.\n\nSo for any grade >0.0 (but <=0.7), it's D-, but wait that can't be because 0.5 would be D- according to this, but the next threshold is 0.7 for D.\n\nWait no, perhaps I misread the table.\n\nLooking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe table lists:\n\n- GPA of 4.0: A+\n- GPA >3.7: A\n- GPA >3.3: A-\n- GPA >3.0: B+\n- GPA >2.7: B\n- GPA >2.3: B-\n- GPA >2.0: C+\n- GPA >1.7: C\n- GPA >1.3: C-\n- GPA >1.0: D+ \n- GPA >0.7: D \n- GPA >0.0: D-\n- GPA =0.0: E\n\nSo, for example:\n\nIf GPA is 0.5, it's greater than 0.0 but less than or equal to 0.7, so it falls into the D category.\n\nWait no, because the next threshold after 1.0 is 0.7 for D, and then >0.0: D-.\n\nSo perhaps I need to structure the thresholds correctly.\n\nLet me try to list all the conditions in order from highest to lowest:\n\nGrade >=4.0 \u2192 A+\n\nElse if grade >3.7 \u2192 A\n\nElse if grade >3.3 \u2192 A-\n\nElse if grade >3.0 \u2192 B+\n\nElse if grade >2.7 \u2192 B\n\nElse if grade >2.3 \u2192 B-\n\nElse if grade >2.0 \u2192 C+\n\nElse if grade >1.7 \u2192 C\n\nElse if grade >1.3 \u2192 C-\n\nElse if grade >1.0 \u2192 D+\n\nElse if grade >0.7 \u2192 D\n\nElse if grade >0.0 \u2192 D-\n\nElse (grade ==0.0) \u2192 E\n\nSo in code, for a given grade, I can check each condition in this order.\n\nAlternatively, create a vector of pairs where the first element is the threshold and the second is the letter, ordered from highest to lowest.\n\nBut wait, 4.0 is an exact match, so perhaps it's better to handle that first.\n\nSo let me structure the code as follows:\n\nFor a given grade:\n\nif (grade >=4.0) return \"A+\"\n\nelse if (grade >3.7) return \"A\"\n\nelse if (grade >3.3) return \"A-\"\n\nelse if (grade >3.0) return \"B+\"\n\nelse if (grade >2.7) return \"B\"\n\nelse if (grade >2.3) return \"B-\"\n\nelse if (grade >2.0) return \"C+\"\n\nelse if (grade >1.7) return \"C\"\n\nelse if (grade >1.3) return \"C-\"\n\nelse if (grade >1.0) return \"D+\"\n\nelse if (grade >0.7) return \"D\"\n\nelse if (grade >0.0) return \"D-\"\n\nelse return \"E\"\n\nWait, but what about a grade of exactly 3.7? It would fall into the second condition (grade>3.7 is false, so it goes to else if grade>3.3 which is true, so returns A-.\n\nBut according to the table, grades above 3.7 are A, and 3.7 itself should be included in A or not?\n\nWait no: the way the problem states:\n\n4.0 is A+\n\nThen >3.7 is A\n\nSo 3.7 would fall into the next condition (grade>3.3) which is true because 3.7>3.3, so it returns A-.\n\nBut according to the table, grades above 3.7 are A, and 3.7 itself should be included in A or not?\n\nWait no: The way it's written, 4.0 is A+, then anything greater than 3.7 (so up to but not including 4.0) is A.\n\nSo for a grade of exactly 3.7, it would fall into the next condition because 3.7>3.3, so it returns A-.\n\nBut according to the table, grades above 3.7 are A, which suggests that 3.7 itself should be included in A.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to adjust the conditions.\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nThe way the problem is written, each condition is a strict greater than except for the highest ones.\n\nSo:\n\n- 4.0: exactly A+\n\nThen, any grade >3.7 (so 3.8 and above) up to less than 4.0 is A\n\nThen, grades >3.3 but <=3.7 are A-\n\nSimilarly, grades >2.7 but <=3.3 are B+, etc.\n\nWait no: the way it's written in the problem is:\n\n- GPA of 4.0 \u2192 A+\n\n- GPA >3.7 \u2192 A\n\nSo that would mean that any grade above 3.7 (including 3.8, 3.9, up to but not including 4.0) is A.\n\nBut what about a grade exactly equal to 3.7? It's greater than 3.3, so it falls into the next condition and returns A-.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, grades above 3.7 are A, which would include 3.8, but not 3.7.\n\nWait no: perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the problem again:\n\nThe table says:\n\n- GPA of 4.0 \u2192 A+\n\n- GPA >3.7 \u2192 A\n\nSo that suggests that any GPA greater than 3.7 (so 3.8 and above) is A, but exactly 3.7 would not be included in A.\n\nBut then, the next condition is GPA>3.3 \u2192 A-\n\nSo a GPA of exactly 3.7 is greater than 3.3, so it falls into A-.\n\nSimilarly, a GPA of exactly 3.5 would also fall into A-.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the categories are:\n\nA+ for 4.0\n\nA for >3.7\n\nA- for >3.3\n\nB+ for >2.7\n\nand so on.\n\nSo perhaps I need to structure the conditions correctly.\n\nLet me try to write code that reflects this.\n\nFor example:\n\nif (grade >=4.0) return \"A+\"\n\nelse if (grade >3.7) return \"A\"\n\nelse if (grade >3.3) return \"A-\"\n\nelse if (grade >2.7) return \"B+\"\n\nelse if (grade >2.3) return \"B\"\n\nelse if (grade >2.0) return \"B-\"\n\nWait, no: the problem says:\n\nAfter A+, it's GPA>3.7 \u2192 A\n\nThen GPA>3.3 \u2192 A-\n\nThen GPA>2.7 \u2192 B+\n\nWait, no: looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe table lists:\n\n- GPA of 4.0 \u2192 A+\n\n- GPA >3.7 \u2192 A\n\n- GPA >3.3 \u2192 A-\n\n- GPA >2.7 \u2192 B+\n\n- GPA >2.3 \u2192 B\n\n- GPA >2.0 \u2192 C+\n\n- GPA >1.7 \u2192 C\n\n- GPA >1.3 \u2192 C-\n\n- GPA >1.0 \u2192 D+\n\n- GPA >0.7 \u2192 D\n\n- GPA >0.0 \u2192 D-\n\n- GPA of 0.0 \u2192 E\n\nSo the order is:\n\nCheck for A+ first.\n\nThen, if not, check if GPA>3.7 \u2192 A.\n\nIf not, check if GPA>3.3 \u2192 A-.\n\nIf not, check if GPA>2.7 \u2192 B+\n\nWait no: according to the problem statement, after A+, it's GPA>3.7 \u2192 A, then GPA>3.3 \u2192 A-, then GPA>2.7 \u2192 B+.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif (grade >=4.0) return \"A+\"\n\nelse if (grade >3.7) return \"A\"\n\nelse if (grade >3.3) return \"A-\"\n\nelse if (grade >2.7) return \"B+\"\n\nelse if (grade >2.3) return \"B\"\n\nelse if (grade >2.0) return \"B-\"\n\nelse if (grade >1.7) return \"C+\"\n\nelse if (grade >1.3) return \"C\"\n\nelse if (grade >1.0) return \"D+\"\n\nelse if (grade >0.7) return \"D\"\n\nelse if (grade >0.0) return \"D-\"\n\nelse return \"E\"\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, after GPA>2.3 \u2192 B, then GPA>2.0 \u2192 C+, etc.\n\nSo I think that's correct.\n\nLet me test some examples:\n\nExample 1: grade =4.0 \u2192 A+\n\nExample 2: grade=3.8 \u2192 A\n\ngrade=3.7 \u2192 not >3.7, so check if >3.3 \u2192 yes, return A-\n\ngrade=3.5 \u2192 same as above.\n\ngrade=3.3 \u2192 is it >3.3? No, because it's equal. So next condition: grade>2.7? 3.3>2.7 \u2192 yes, returns B+.\n\nWait no: according to the problem statement, after A- comes B+, which is for GPA>2.7.\n\nSo if grade=3.3:\n\ngrade >=4.0? No\n\ngrade >3.7? No (3.3 <3.7)\n\ngrade >3.3? 3.3 is not greater than 3.3, so no.\n\nNext condition: grade>2.7 \u2192 yes, returns B+.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother example: grade=2.8\n\nCheck:\n\n>=4.0? No\n\n>3.7? No\n\n>3.3? No (2.8 <3.3)\n\n>2.7? 2.8>2.7 \u2192 yes, returns B+.\n\nWait no: according to the problem statement, after A- comes B+, which is for GPA>2.7.\n\nSo grade=2.8 would be in B+.\n\nAnother example: grade=2.6\n\ngrade >=4.0? No\n\n>3.7? No\n\n>3.3? No\n\n>2.7? 2.6 <2.7 \u2192 no\n\nNext condition: >2.3? Yes, returns B.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after B+ comes B for GPA>2.3.\n\nSo grade=2.6 is in B.\n\nAnother example: grade=2.0\n\ngrade >=4.0? No\n\n>3.7? No\n\n>3.3? No\n\n>2.7? 2.0 <2.7 \u2192 no\n\n>2.3? 2.0 <2.3 \u2192 no\n\nNext condition: >2.0? Yes, returns B-.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after B comes B- for GPA>2.0.\n\nSo grade=2.0 is in B-.\n\nAnother example: grade=1.5\n\ngrade >=4.0? No\n\n>3.7? No\n\n>3.3? No\n\n>2.7? No\n\n>2.3? No (1.5 <2.3)\n\nNext condition: >2.0? No\n\nThen, next condition: >1.7 \u2192 1.5 <1.7 \u2192 no.\n\nNext: >1.3 \u2192 yes, returns C.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after B- comes C+ for GPA>1.7.\n\nSo grade=1.5 is less than 1.7, so it would fall into C.\n\nAnother example: grade=0.5\n\ngrade >=4.0? No\n\n>3.7? No\n\n>3.3? No\n\n>2.7? No\n\n>2.3? No\n\n>2.0? No\n\n>1.7? No (0.5 <1.7)\n\nNext: >1.3 \u2192 0.5 <1.3 \u2192 no.\n\nNext: >1.0 \u2192 yes, returns D+.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after C comes D+ for GPA>1.0.\n\nSo grade=0.5 is in D+.\n\nAnother example: grade=0.6\n\ngrade >=4.0? No\n\n>3.7? No\n\n>3.3? No\n\n>2.7? No\n\n>2.3? No\n\n>2.0? No\n\n>1.7? No (0.6 <1.7)\n\nNext: >1.3 \u2192 0.6 <1.3 \u2192 no.\n\nNext: >1.0 \u2192 yes, returns D+.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after C comes D+ for GPA>1.0.\n\nSo grade=0.6 is in D+.\n\nAnother example: grade=0.4\n\ngrade >=4.0? No\n\n>3.7? No\n\n>3.3? No\n\n>2.7? No\n\n>2.3? No\n\n>2.0? No\n\n>1.7? No (0.4 <1.7)\n\nNext: >1.3 \u2192 0.4 <1.3 \u2192 no.\n\nNext: >1.0 \u2192 yes, returns D+.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after C comes D+ for GPA>1.0.\n\nSo grade=0.4 is in D+.\n\nAnother example: grade=0.0\n\ngrade >=4.0? No\n\n>3.7? No\n\n>3.3? No\n\n>2.7? No\n\n>2.3? No\n\n>2.0? No\n\n>1.7? No (0.0 <1.7)\n\nNext: >1.3 \u2192 0.0 <1.3 \u2192 no.\n\nNext: >1.0 \u2192 0.0 <1.0 \u2192 no.\n\nNext condition: >0.7 \u2192 0.0 <0.7 \u2192 no.\n\nFinally, returns D.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after D+ comes D for GPA>0.7.\n\nSo grade=0.0 is in D.\n\nAnother example: grade=0.8\n\ngrade >=4.0? No\n\n>3.7? No\n\n>3.3? No\n\n>2.7? No\n\n>2.3? No\n\n>2.0? No\n\n>1.7? No (0.8 <1.7)\n\nNext: >1.3 \u2192 0.8 <1.3 \u2192 no.\n\nNext: >1.0 \u2192 yes, returns D+.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after C comes D+ for GPA>1.0.\n\nSo grade=0.8 is in D+.\n\nAnother example: grade=0.9\n\nSame as above, returns D+.\n\nBut if grade=0.5:\n\ngrade >=4.0? No\n\n>3.7? No\n\n>3.3? No\n\n>2.7? No\n\n>2.3? No\n\n>2.0? No\n\n>1.7? No (0.5 <1.7)\n\nNext: >1.3 \u2192 0.5 <1.3 \u2192 no.\n\nNext: >1.0 \u2192 yes, returns D+.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after C comes D+ for GPA>1.0.\n\nSo grade=0.5 is in D+.\n\nBut what about grade=0.6?\n\nSame as above, returns D+.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after C comes D+ for GPA>1.0.\n\nSo grades between 1.0 and below are in D+, but wait no:\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem statement says:\n\n- If your score is greater than 1.7, you get a C+.\n\n- If your score is greater than 1.0 but less than or equal to 1.7, you get a C.\n\n- If your score is greater than 0.7 but less than or equal to 1.0, you get a D+.\n\nWait no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\nThe grading scale is as follows:\n\n- If your score is greater than 1.7, you get an A.\n\n- If your score is between 1.5 and 2.0 (inclusive), you get a B.\n\n- If your score is between 1.3 and 1.7 (exclusive of 1.7), you get a C+.\n\nWait no, let me read the problem statement again:\n\nThe grading scale is as follows:\n\n- If your score is greater than 1.7, you get an A.\n\n- If your score is between 1.5 and 2.0 (inclusive), you get a B.\n\n- If your score is between 1.3 and 1.7 (exclusive of 1.7), you get a C+.\n\nWait no, that's not correct.

{"task_id": "CPP/147", "generation": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of triplets (i.e., groups of three) from a given list of integers such that the sum of each triplet is divisible by 3. This can be efficiently achieved by leveraging modular arithmetic and combinatorial counting.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Modular Arithmetic**: For each integer in the list, compute its residue modulo 3. This will give us one of three possible residues: 0, 1, or 2.\n2. **Counting Residues**: Count how many numbers fall into each residue category (0, 1, and 2).\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**: Use combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid triplets:\n   - **Same Residue Triplets**: For each residue category, if there are at least three numbers with that residue, compute how many ways we can choose three numbers from them.\n   - **Mixed Residue Triplets**: Compute the number of ways to choose one number from each of the three residue categories.\n\n### Solution Code\n"}
