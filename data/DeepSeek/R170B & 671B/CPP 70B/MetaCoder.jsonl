This method ensures that each opening bracket '(' has a corresponding closing bracket ')' in the correct order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Stack Initialization**: We use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. Each time we encounter an '(', we push it onto the stack.\n2. **Processing Each Character**: As we iterate through each character in the string:\n   - If the character is '(', we push it onto the stack.\n   - If the character is ')', we check if the stack is empty. If it is, this means there's no corresponding '(', so we return false.

If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched '(', and we return false.\n\nThis approach ensures that each bracket is processed in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.

Each '(', when encountered, is pushed onto the stack.\n- **Matching Brackets**: For each ')', we check if there's a corresponding '(' in the stack. If there is, we pop it from the stack, effectively matching the pair. If there isn't, the string is unbalanced.\n- **Final Check**: After processing all characters, an empty stack indicates all brackets were matched correctly, while a non-empty stack indicates unmatched '('. \n\nThis method efficiently ensures that the string of brackets is correctly bracketed by leveraging the stack data structure to maintain the order and pairing of brackets."}

A simple power is defined as `n^k = x` for some integer `k`. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the function works:\n\n1. **Edge Cases Handling**:\n   - **Case 1: `n` is 0**  \n     If `n` is 0, the function returns `False` immediately because 0 raised to any power is undefined, and no `x` can be a power of 0.\n   - **Case 2: `x` is 0**  \n     If `x` is 0, the function returns `False` because 0 cannot be expressed as `n^k` unless `n` is 0, which is already handled.\n   - **Case 3: `n` is 1**  \n     If `n` is 1, the function checks if `x` is 1. This is because 1 raised to any power is always 1.\n   - **Case 4: `n` is -1**  \n     If `n` is -1, the function checks if `x` is either 1 or -1. This is because (-1) raised to any integer power alternates between 1 and -1.\n\n2. **Absolute Value Check**:\n   - The function converts both `x` and `n` to their absolute values (`abs_x` and `abs_n`). This simplifies the problem by reducing it to dealing with positive numbers, making it easier to check divisibility and powers.\n\n3. **Power Check Loop**:\n   - The function enters a loop where it repeatedly divides `abs_x` by `abs_n` and increments a counter `k`. This loop continues until `abs_x` becomes 1.\n   - If at any point `abs_x` is not divisible by `abs_n`, the function returns `False` because `x` cannot be a power of `n`.\n\n4. **Sign Compatibility Check**:\n   - After confirming that the absolute values fit the power relationship, the function checks the sign compatibility between `x` and `n^k`.\n     - If `n` is positive, `x` must also be positive because any positive number raised to any power remains positive.\n     - If `n` is negative, the function checks whether `k` is even or odd:\n       - If `k` is even, `n^k` is positive, so `x` must be positive.\n       - If `k` is odd, `n^k` is negative, so `x` must be negative.\n\n5. **Return Result**:\n   - If all the above conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`, indicating that `x` is indeed a simple power of `n`.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that all possible cases are covered, and the function efficiently determines whether `x` is a simple power of `n` by breaking down the problem into manageable steps and handling edge cases appropriately."}

The variable `third_index` is used to keep track of the current position in the `third_elements` list.\n     - If `i` is not divisible by three, the element from the original list `l` at that index is appended to `new_l`.\n\n4. **Returning the Result:**\n   - After processing all indices, the newly constructed list `new_l` is returned. This list has the same elements as the original list `l`, except for the elements at indices divisible by three, which are now sorted in ascending order.\n\n**Efficiency Considerations:**\n- The algorithm runs in O(n log n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the list. This is primarily due to the sorting step, which is O(k log k) for k elements at indices divisible by three. In the worst case, if every third element is present, k is approximately n/3, leading to O(n log n) complexity.\n- The space complexity is O(n), as the algorithm creates a new list to store the result and an additional list to store the elements at indices divisible by three.\n\n**Correctness:**\n- The code correctly handles edge cases such as lists with fewer than three elements, lists where no elements are at indices divisible by three, and lists where all elements are at indices divisible by three.\n- The use of `third_index` ensures that the sorted elements are placed in the correct order in the new list.\n\nOverall, the approach is efficient and correctly addresses the problem requirements by focusing only on the necessary elements and leaving the rest of the list unchanged."}

This ensures that only valid numbers are processed further.\n2. **Sorting**: The filtered numbers are then sorted in ascending order.

This step ensures that any invalid numbers are excluded from further processing.\n2. **Sorting**: The `sort()` method is called on the `filtered` list, which sorts the numbers in ascending order. This is a straightforward step that leverages Python's built-in sorting functionality.\n3. **Reversing**: The sorted list is reversed using slicing `[::-1]`, which creates a new list that is the reverse of the sorted list. This step arranges the numbers in descending order as required.\n4. **Conversion**: Another list comprehension `[num_to_word[num] for num in filtered_reversed]` is used to convert each number in the reversed list to its corresponding word.

These will keep track of the number of even and odd digits, respectively.\n\n2. **Absolute Value Handling**:\n   - The input number `num` is converted to its absolute value using `num = abs(num)`. This ensures that negative numbers are processed correctly, as the sign does not affect the evenness or oddness of the digits.\n\n3. **Zero Handling**:\n   - If `num` is zero, the `even` counter is incremented by 1. This is because zero is an even number, and it's the only digit in this case.\n\n4. **Digit Extraction and Counting**:\n   - For non-zero numbers, a while loop is used to process each digit. The loop continues as long as `num` is greater than zero.\n   - Inside the loop, the last digit of `num` is extracted using `num % 10` and stored in the variable `digit`.\n   - The digit is checked for evenness using the condition `if digit % 2 == 0`. If true, the `even` counter is incremented; otherwise, the `odd` counter is incremented.\n   - After processing the digit, the last digit is removed from `num` by performing integer division by 10 (`num = num // 10`).\n\n5. **Return Result**:\n   - Once all digits have been processed, the function returns a list containing the counts of even and odd digits, respectively.\n\n**Efficiency and Correctness**:\n- The function processes each digit exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input number.

If the balance ever becomes negative, it indicates an unmatched closing bracket, and the function returns false.

Immediately return false in such cases.\n4. **Final Balance Check**: After processing all characters, if the balance is zero, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so the bracketing is correct.

Non-alphabetic characters are added to `result` without modification. The function returns the resulting string after processing all characters.

It iterates through each number, skips those less than or equal to 10, and extracts the first and last digits. The first digit is obtained by repeatedly dividing the absolute value of the number by 10 until it is a single digit. The last digit is obtained using the modulus operator on the absolute value. Both digits are checked for oddness, and the count is incremented if both are odd. This solution efficiently processes each number and correctly counts those meeting the criteria.", "py_summary": "\n\nThe Python code for the `specialFilter` function is designed to count the number of elements in a list of integers that meet specific criteria.

Split the string into words based on whitespace if any exists.\n2. If no whitespace is found, split the string based on commas.\n3. If neither whitespace nor commas are present, count the number of lowercase letters in the string that have an odd position in the alphabet (where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, ..., 'z' is 25) and return this count as a single-element list.\n\n### Python Code Analysis\n\n```python\ndef split_words(txt):\n    # Check for whitespace\n    if ' ' in txt:\n        return txt.split()\n    \n    # Check for commas\n    elif ',' in txt:\n        return txt.split(',')\n    \n    # Count lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet\n    else:\n        count = 0\n        for c in txt:\n            if c.islower():\n                pos = ord(c) - ord('a')\n                if pos % 2 == 1:\n                    count += 1\n        return [str(count)]\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1. **Check for Whitespace**:\n   - The code first checks if there is any whitespace in the input string `txt` using `' ' in txt`.\n   - If whitespace is found, the string is split into words using the `split()` method, which by default splits on any whitespace and returns a list of words.\n\n2. **Check for Commas**:\n   - If no whitespace is found, the code then checks for commas using `',' in txt`.\n   - If commas are present, the string is split using `split(',')`, which divides the string at each comma and returns a list of substrings.\n\n3. **Count Lowercase Letters with Odd Alphabet Positions**:\n   - If neither whitespace nor commas are found, the code proceeds to count the number of lowercase letters that have an odd position in the alphabet.\n   - A counter `count` is initialized to zero.\n   - The code iterates over each character `c` in the string `txt`.\n   - For each character, it checks if it is a lowercase letter using `c.islower()`.\n   - If it is a lowercase letter, the position in the alphabet is calculated as `pos = ord(c) - ord('a')`, where `ord(c)` gives the ASCII value of the character.\n   - If the position `pos` is odd (`pos % 2 == 1`), the counter `count` is incremented by 1.\n   - Finally, the count is converted to a string and returned as a single-element list `[str(count)]`.\n\n### Efficiency and Correctness\n\n- **Efficiency**: The code efficiently checks for the presence of whitespace and commas in the string, ensuring that the appropriate splitting method is used. The counting of lowercase letters is done in a single pass through the string, making it efficient.\n- **Correctness**: The code correctly handles all specified cases:\n  - Splits on whitespace when present.\n  - Splits on commas when whitespace is absent but commas are present.\n  - Counts and returns the appropriate value when neither whitespace nor commas are found.\n\nThis approach ensures that the problem is solved in an optimal and straightforward manner, adhering to the given constraints and requirements."}

If both lists have the same total number of characters, the function returns the first list. Here's a detailed analysis of how the code works:\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Characters for Each List:**\n   - The function begins by calculating the total number of characters in each list. This is done using a generator expression within the `sum()` function.\n   - For `lst1`, it iterates over each string `s` and computes `len(s)`, which gives the number of characters in that string. The `sum()` function then adds up all these lengths to get `sum1`.\n   - Similarly, for `lst2`, the same process is applied to compute `sum2`.\n\n2. **Comparison of Totals:**\n   - After obtaining `sum1` and `sum2`, the function compares these two values.\n   - If `sum1` is less than or equal to `sum2`, the function returns `lst1`.\n   - Otherwise, it returns `lst2`.\n\n3. **Return the Appropriate List:**\n   - The decision of which list to return is based on the comparison of the total characters.\n   - This ensures that the list with fewer total characters is returned, or the first list if both totals are equal.\n\n### Key Features of the Code:\n\n- **Efficiency:** The solution efficiently calculates the total characters by iterating through each list only once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.\n- **Readability:** The use of generator expressions and a conditional expression makes the code concise and easy to understand.\n- **Correctness:** The code handles all edge cases, including empty lists and lists with equal total characters, as specified in the problem statement.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\nLet's consider the example provided:\n\n- **Example 1:** `total_match({}, {})` should return `{}`.\n  - Both lists are empty, so `sum1` and `sum2` are both 0. The function returns `lst1`, which is an empty list.\n\n- **Example 2:** `total_match({\"hi\", \"admin\"}, {\"hI\", \"Hi\"})` should return `{\"hI\", \"Hi\"}`.\n  - `sum1` is `2 + 5 = 7` (from \"hi\" and \"admin\").\n  - `sum2` is `2 + 2 = 4` (from \"hI\" and \"Hi\").\n  - Since `sum2` is less than `sum1`, the function returns `lst2`.\n\n- **Example 3:** `total_match({\"hi\", \"admin\"}, {\"hi\", \"hi\", \"admin\", \"project\"})` should return `{\"hi\", \"admin\"}`.\n  - `sum1` is `2 + 5 = 7`.\n  - `sum2` is `2 + 2 + 5 + 7 = 16`.\n  - Since `sum1` is less than `sum2`, the function returns `lst1`.\n\n- **Example 4:** `total_match({\"hi\", \"admin\"}, {\"hI\", \"hi\", \"hi\"})` should return `{\"hI\", \"hi\", \"hi\"}`.\n  - `sum1` is `2 + 5 = 7`.\n  - `sum2` is `2 + 2 + 2 = 6`.\n  - Since `sum2` is less than `sum1`, the function returns `lst2`.\n\n- **Example 5:** `total_match({\"4\"}, {\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\"})` should return `{\"4\"}`.\n  - `sum1` is `1` (from \"4\").\n  - `sum2` is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.\n  - Since `sum1` is less than `sum2`, the function returns `lst1`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Python code provided is an optimal and clear solution to the problem. It efficiently calculates the total number of characters in each list, compares these totals, and returns the appropriate list based on the comparison. The solution handles all specified cases correctly and is easy to understand due to its concise and readable implementation."}

Here's a detailed breakdown of how the code works and its underlying logic:\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   ```python\n   def count_upper(s):\n   ```\n   - This defines a function named `count_upper` that takes a single parameter `s`, which is the input string.\n\n2. **Initialization**:\n   ```python\n   count = 0\n   vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}\n   ```\n   - `count` is initialized to zero. This variable will keep track of the number of uppercase vowels found at even indices.\n   - `vowels` is a set containing the uppercase vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'. Using a set is efficient for membership testing.\n\n3. **Loop Through the String**:\n   ```python\n   for i in range(len(s)):\n   ```\n   - This loop iterates over each index `i` in the string `s`, from 0 to `len(s) - 1`.\n\n4. **Check Conditions**:\n   ```python\n   if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] in vowels:\n   ```\n   - `i % 2 == 0` checks if the current index `i` is even.\n   - `s[i] in vowels` checks if the character at index `i` is an uppercase vowel.\n   - Both conditions must be true for the character to be counted.\n\n5. **Increment Counter**:\n   ```python\n   count += 1\n   ```\n   - If both conditions are satisfied, the `count` variable is incremented by one.\n\n6. **Return the Result**:\n   ```python\n   return count\n   ```\n   - After the loop completes, the function returns the total count of uppercase vowels found at even indices.\n\n**Analysis of the Code**\n\n- **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the string. This is because it makes a single pass through the string, checking each character exactly once. The space complexity is O(1) since only a fixed amount of additional space is used (for `count` and `vowels`).\n\n- **Correctness**: The code correctly identifies uppercase vowels at even indices by checking both the index and the character. It handles various edge cases, such as:\n  - An empty string: The loop doesn't execute, and `count` remains zero.\n  - Strings with no uppercase vowels: `count` remains zero.\n  - Strings with all characters as uppercase vowels: All even indices are counted.\n  - Mixed-case strings: Only uppercase vowels at even indices are counted.\n\n- **Readability and Maintainability**: The code is concise and easy to understand. The use of a set for vowels makes the membership test clear and efficient. The variable names are descriptive, enhancing readability.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Python code efficiently and correctly counts the number of uppercase vowels at even indices in a string. Its linear time complexity ensures that it performs well even for longer strings, and its straightforward logic makes it easy to understand and maintain."}

When a non-space character is encountered, it checks the count of consecutive spaces and appends the appropriate replacement (underscore or hyphen) to the result. This ensures that all space groups are handled correctly, including those at the end of the string. The approach efficiently handles the replacement in a single pass through the string, making it both time and space efficient.", "py_summary": "\n\nThe Python code for the `fix_spaces` function efficiently replaces spaces in a string according to specific rules.

Sorting helps in easily identifying and removing consecutive duplicate elements.\n2. **Remove Duplicates**: After sorting, we use the `std::unique` function from the C++ Standard Library.

This variable will hold the factorial of the current number in each iteration.\n\n2. **Loop Through Numbers**:\n   - The loop runs from 1 to n (inclusive).\n   - In each iteration, `current_factorial` is multiplied by the current number `i`. This effectively calculates the factorial of `i` incrementally.\n   - `result` is then multiplied by `current_factorial`, accumulating the product of all factorials up to `i`.\n\n3. **Efficiency**:\n   - The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity since it iterates through each number from 1 to n exactly once.\n   - Each iteration involves a constant-time multiplication operation, making the algorithm efficient.\n\n4. **Correctness**:\n   - For each `i`, `current_factorial` correctly computes `i!` by building on the previous factorial value.\n   - `result` accumulates the product of these factorials, ensuring that by the end of the loop, it holds the Brazilian factorial of `n`.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - The code handles the case when `n=1` correctly, returning 1 as expected.\n   - Since the problem specifies that `n > 0`, the code does not need to handle `n=0`.\n\n6. **Readability**:\n   - Variable names like `result` and `current_factorial` are descriptive, making the code easy to understand.\n   - The loop structure is straightforward, enhancing readability.\n\nIn summary, the Python code efficiently and correctly computes the Brazilian factorial by iteratively calculating each factorial and accumulating their product, ensuring optimal performance and clarity."}

The intervals are represented as pairs of integers, and each interval is closed, meaning it includes both its start and end points.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Find the Intersection**: The intersection of two intervals (a, b) and (c, d) is determined by the maximum of the start points (s = max(a, c)) and the minimum of the end points (e = min(b, d)). If s is greater than e, there is no intersection.\n2. **Calculate the Length**: The length of the intersection is calculated as e - s.

If `s` is greater than `e`, it means there is no overlap, and the function returns \"NO\".\n2. **Calculating the Length**: The length of the intersection is computed as `e - s`.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of how the code works:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `incr_list` is defined to take a single parameter `l`, which is expected to be a list of integers.\n\n2. **List Comprehension**: The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list.

This list can contain any number of integer elements, including an empty list.\n\n- **List Comprehension Execution**:\n  - Iterate over each element `x` in the list `l`.\n  - For each `x`, compute `x + 1`.\n  - Collect all these incremented values into a new list.\n\n- **Output**: The function returns the new list containing all elements incremented by 1.\n\n**Example Walkthrough**:\n\n- **Sample Input 1**: `[1, 2, 3]`\n  - For each element:\n    - `1 + 1 = 2`\n    - `2 + 1 = 3`\n    - `3 + 1 = 4`\n  - **Output**: `[2, 3, 4]`\n\n- **Sample Input 2**: `[5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`\n  - For each element:\n    - `5 + 1 = 6`\n    - `3 + 1 = 4`\n    - `5 + 1 = 6`\n    - `2 + 1 = 3`\n    - `3 + 1 = 4`\n    - `3 + 1 = 4`\n    - `9 + 1 = 10`\n    - `0 + 1 = 1`\n    - `123 + 1 = 124`\n  - **Output**: `[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]`\n\n**Efficiency**:\n\n- The function processes each element of the list exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is optimal for this problem since each element needs to be accessed and modified.\n\n- The space complexity is also O(n) because a new list of the same size is created to store the incremented values.\n\n**Edge Cases**:\n\n- **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list immediately, which is the correct behavior.\n\n- **Single Element List**: If the list contains only one element, the function will return a list with that single element incremented by 1.\n\n- **Negative Numbers**: The function correctly handles negative numbers by incrementing them as expected (e.g., `-1 + 1 = 0`).\n\n- **Zero**: Incrementing zero results in 1, which is handled correctly.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThe Python code for the `incr_list` function is efficient, straightforward, and handles all possible input cases appropriately.

The function returns the result of this operation as a string. Here's a detailed analysis of how the code works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - An empty list named `result` is initialized to collect the individual bits of the output string. Using a list is efficient because appending elements to a list is faster than concatenating strings in a loop.\n\n2. **Iteration**:\n   - A `for` loop iterates over each index of the input strings using `range(len(a))`. This assumes that both strings `a` and `b` are of the same length. If they are not, the loop will process only up to the length of the shorter string, which may or may not be the intended behavior depending on the problem constraints.\n\n3. **XOR Operation**:\n   - For each index `i`, the code checks if the characters at `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different. \n     - If `a[i] != b[i]`, it appends `'1'` to the `result` list, as the XOR of two different bits is '1'.\n     - If `a[i] == b[i]`, it appends `'0'` to the `result` list, as the XOR of two identical bits is '0'.\n\n4. **Result Construction**:\n   - After the loop completes, the function uses `''.join(result)` to concatenate all the elements of the `result` list into a single string, which is then returned as the final output.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - **Empty Strings**: If either `a` or `b` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and an empty string will be returned.\n   - **Different Lengths**: If `a` and `b` are of different lengths, the loop processes only up to the length of the shorter string. Any extra characters in the longer string are ignored. Depending on the problem requirements, this might be acceptable or might need additional handling.\n   - **Invalid Characters**: The problem statement specifies that the input strings consist only of '0's and '1's, so the code does not include error checking for invalid characters.\n\n6. **Efficiency**:\n   - The use of a list to collect results and then joining them into a string is efficient, especially for longer strings, as it avoids the overhead of repeated string concatenation in a loop.\n\nIn summary, the Python code efficiently performs the binary XOR operation on two strings of equal length, producing the correct result string. It assumes that the inputs are valid binary strings and handles typical cases effectively."}

This target represents the sum needed from the other two elements to make the triplet sum zero.\n\n4. **Two-Pointer Technique**: \n   - A left pointer starts just after the current element.\n   - A right pointer starts at the end of the list.\n   - The algorithm calculates the sum of the elements at these pointers.\n     - If the sum equals the target, a triplet is found, and the function returns `True`.\n     - If the sum is less than the target, the left pointer is moved right to increase the sum.\n     - If the sum is greater than the target, the right pointer is moved left to decrease the sum.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The sorting step takes O(n log n) time, and each iteration of the for loop uses a two-pointer traversal that takes O(n) time, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n^2).

It repeatedly applies the Euclidean algorithm by replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. The value of `a` at this point is the GCD, which is then returned.\n\n2. **C++ Solution**: The function `greatest_common_divisor` first converts both integers to their absolute values to handle negative inputs correctly. It then uses a loop to apply the Euclidean algorithm, similar to the Python solution, until `b` becomes zero. The value of `a` at the end of the loop is the GCD, which is returned.\n\nBoth solutions efficiently compute the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, ensuring optimal performance even for large integers.", "py_summary": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. We will use the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient and straightforward for this purpose.\n\n### Approach\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly applying the division algorithm to reduce the problem of finding the GCD of two numbers to smaller pairs of numbers. Here are the steps involved:\n\n1. **Convert to Absolute Values**: Since the GCD is always non-negative, we first convert both input numbers to their absolute values.\n2. **Iterative Division**: Using a loop, we repeatedly replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until the remainder becomes zero. At this point, the non-zero remainder (which is now the smaller number) is the GCD.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a, b):\n    a = abs(a)\n    b = abs(b)\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Absolute Values**: The function starts by converting both `a` and `b` to their absolute values to handle any negative inputs.\n2. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `b` is not zero. In each iteration, `a` is set to `b`, and `b` is set to `a % b` (the remainder of `a` divided by `b`).\n3. **GCD Found**: When `b` becomes zero, `a` holds the GCD of the original two numbers, which is then returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, ensuring optimal performance even for large integers."}

Using modulo 26 ensures that if the shift goes past 'z', it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.\n3. **Reconstruction**: The shifted position is converted back to a character, and this character is added to the result string.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each character in linear time, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage required for the result string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef encrypt(s):\n    encrypted = []\n    for c in s:\n        shifted = (ord(c) - ord('a') + 4) % 26\n        encrypted_char = chr(shifted + ord('a'))\n        encrypted.append(encrypted_char)\n    return ''.join(encrypted)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: An empty list `encrypted` is initialized to collect the encrypted characters.\n- **Loop Through Each Character**: For each character `c` in the input string `s`, the character is processed.\n- **Calculate Shifted Position**: \n  - `ord(c)` gives the ASCII value of the character.\n  - Subtracting `ord('a')` converts it to a zero-based index (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).\n  - Adding 4 shifts the character four places forward.\n  - Using modulo 26 ensures that if the shift goes past 'z', it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.\n- **Convert Back to Character**: \n  - `shifted + ord('a')` converts the zero-based index back to the ASCII value.\n  - `chr()` converts this ASCII value back to a character.\n- **Build the Result**: Each encrypted character is appended to the `encrypted` list, which is then joined into a single string and returned.\n\nThis method ensures that each character is correctly shifted and wrapped around, providing the desired encrypted string efficiently."}

If the count is exactly one, we include the element in the result list. This ensures that the order of elements is preserved as required.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input vector, making it suitable for large datasets.", "py_summary": "\n\nTo solve the problem of removing all elements that occur more than once from a vector of integers while preserving the order, we can follow a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n1. **Count Frequencies**: \n   - Traverse the input list and count the frequency of each integer using a dictionary. This helps in quickly determining how many times each element appears.\n\n2. **Filter Elements**:\n   - Iterate through the original list again and construct a new list that includes only those elements whose count is exactly one. This ensures that the order of elements is preserved as required.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - The newly constructed list, which contains only the unique elements in their original order, is returned as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and easy to understand. The use of a dictionary allows for quick lookups, making the overall time complexity linear with respect to the number of elements in the input list.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers):\n    counts = {}\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num in counts:\n            counts[num] += 1\n        else:\n            counts[num] = 1\n    result = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if counts[num] == 1:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```\n\n**Analysis of the Python Code**:\n\n- **Counting Frequencies**: The first loop iterates through each number in the input list and updates the count in the `counts` dictionary. This step ensures that we know exactly how many times each number appears in the list.\n\n- **Filtering Elements**: The second loop goes through the original list again and checks the count of each number in the `counts` dictionary. If a number's count is one, it is added to the `result` list. This step ensures that only unique numbers are included, and their order is preserved.\n\n- **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because both loops iterate through the list once each. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the `counts` dictionary and the `result` list.\n\n- **Readability and Maintainability**: The code is straightforward and easy to understand. The variable names are descriptive, and the logic is clear. Adding comments could further enhance readability, especially for someone unfamiliar with the code.\n\n- **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as an empty input list (returns an empty list) and a list where all elements are duplicates (returns an empty list). Testing these scenarios ensures the function behaves as expected.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging a dictionary for frequency counting and preserving the order of elements during the filtering process."}

Here's a detailed analysis of how the code works:\n\n1. **Helper Function `is_prime(num)`**:\n   - **Purpose**: Determines if a given number `num` is a prime number.\n   - **Logic**:\n     - If `num` is less than 2, it is not prime.\n     - For numbers 2 and greater, the function checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `num`.\n     - If any divisor is found, the number is not prime; otherwise, it is prime.\n\n2. **Main Function `count_up_to(n)`**:\n   - **Purpose**: Collects all prime numbers less than `n`.\n   - **Logic**:\n     - If `n` is 2 or less, returns an empty list since there are no primes less than 2.\n     - Initializes an empty list `primes` to store prime numbers.\n     - Iterates through each number starting from 2 up to `n-1`.\n     - For each number, uses the `is_prime` function to check if it's prime.\n     - If a number is prime, it is added to the `primes` list.\n   - **Output**: Returns the `primes` list containing all prime numbers less than `n`.\n\n**Efficiency Considerations**:\n- The approach checks each number up to `n-1`, which is straightforward but may not be the most efficient for very large values of `n`.\n- The `is_prime` function could be optimized by skipping even numbers after checking for 2, reducing the number of iterations.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe Python code effectively solves the problem by systematically checking each number up to `n-1` for primality and collecting those that meet the criteria.

Each tuple contains an integer value and its corresponding Roman numeral string.\n   - The list is ordered from the largest value (1000) to the smallest (1), ensuring that the algorithm always considers the largest possible symbols first.\n\n2. **Initialization**:\n   - An empty string `result` is initialized to accumulate the Roman numeral symbols as the algorithm progresses.\n\n3. **Iterative Subtraction Algorithm**:\n   - The code iterates over each `value, symbol` pair in the `roman_numerals` list.\n   - For each pair, it checks if the current `number` is greater than or equal to the `value`. If true, it appends the corresponding `symbol` to `result` and subtracts the `value` from `number`.\n   - This process repeats until `number` is reduced to a value that is less than the current `value`, ensuring that each symbol is used the maximum number of times possible.\n\n4. **Constructing the Roman Numeral String**:\n   - By always using the largest possible symbols first, the algorithm efficiently constructs the Roman numeral string.\n   - The loop continues until all relevant symbols have been added to `result`, and `number` is reduced to zero.\n\n5. **Returning the Result**:\n   - Finally, the accumulated `result` string is returned, representing the Roman numeral equivalent of the input integer.\n\n**Example Walkthrough**:\n- For `number = 19`:\n  - The list `roman_numerals` is processed in order.\n  - `1000` is larger than 19, so it's skipped.\n  - `900` is also larger than 19.\n  - This continues until `10` is reached.\n  - `10` is less than or equal to 19, so \"x\" is added to `result`, and `number` becomes 9.\n  - The next value is `9`, which is less than or equal to 9. \"ix\" is added to `result`, and `number` becomes 0.\n  - The final `result` is \"xix\".\n\n**Efficiency**:\n- The algorithm efficiently reduces the number by always subtracting the largest possible value first, minimizing the number of iterations needed.\n- The use of a predefined list of value-symbol pairs makes the code easy to understand and maintain.\n\n**Correctness**:\n- The code correctly handles both additive and subtractive notations in Roman numerals.\n- It ensures that each symbol is used appropriately, avoiding invalid combinations.\n\nOverall, the code is a clear and efficient implementation of a greedy algorithm for converting integers to Roman numerals."}

Here's a detailed analysis of the provided Python code:\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves iterating through the input vector while maintaining a running maximum. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Check if the input vector is empty. If it is, return an empty list.\n   - Initialize the result list with the first element of the input vector since the maximum at the first position is the element itself.\n   - Set the current maximum to this first element.\n\n2. **Iteration**:\n   - Loop through each subsequent element in the input vector starting from the second element.\n   - For each element, compare it with the current maximum.\n     - If the element is greater than the current maximum, update the current maximum to this element.\n   - Append the current maximum to the result list after processing each element.\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - After processing all elements, return the result list which now contains the rolling maximums.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element is processed exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input vector. This makes the solution efficient and suitable for large input sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef rolling_max(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        return []\n    result = [numbers[0]]\n    current_max = numbers[0]\n    for num in numbers[1:]:\n        if num > current_max:\n            current_max = num\n        result.append(current_max)\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The function starts by checking if the input list is empty and returns an empty list if true. Otherwise, it initializes the result list with the first element and sets this as the current maximum.\n- **Iteration**: For each subsequent element in the input list, the function checks if the element is greater than the current maximum. If it is, the current maximum is updated. The current maximum is then appended to the result list.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach processes each element exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity, O(n), which is optimal for this problem.\n\nThis solution effectively computes the rolling maximum by maintaining a running maximum and updating it as it iterates through the input list, ensuring that the result is built incrementally and returned at the end."}

The function initializes two variables, `balance` and `max_balance`, to track the current and maximum depth of nested brackets, respectively. As it iterates through each character in the string:\n- If the character is an opening bracket `[`, it increments the `balance` and updates `max_balance` if the current balance exceeds the previous maximum.\n- If the character is a closing bracket `]`, it decrements the `balance` if it is positive (to avoid negative balances which would indicate invalid sequences).\n- If at any point `max_balance` reaches 2 or more, the function immediately returns `true`, indicating a nested subsequence is found.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the presence of nested brackets in linear time, making it suitable for long strings.\n\n### C++ Solution\n```cpp\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\n\nbool is_nested(string s) {\n    int balance = 0;\n    int max_balance = 0;\n    for (char c : s) {\n        if (c == '[') {\n            balance++;\n            if (balance > max_balance) {\n                max_balance = balance;\n            }\n        } else if (c == ']') {\n            if (balance > 0) {\n                balance--;\n            }\n        }\n        if (max_balance >= 2) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe C++ solution mirrors the Python approach, iterating through each character of the string while maintaining a balance counter. The balance is incremented for each opening bracket and decremented for each closing bracket, ensuring it never goes negative. If the maximum balance reaches 2 at any point, the function returns `true`, indicating a valid nested subsequence. If the loop completes without finding such a subsequence, it returns `false`. This solution efficiently handles the problem in linear time, ensuring optimal performance.", "py_summary": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string of square brackets contains a valid subsequence where at least one pair of brackets is nested. A nested structure means that there is at least one opening bracket followed by another opening bracket before the corresponding closing brackets.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves iterating through the string while keeping track of the current depth of the brackets. Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**: We start by initializing two variables, `balance` and `max_balance`. The `balance` variable keeps track of the current depth of the brackets as we iterate through the string, while `max_balance` records the highest depth encountered.\n\n2. **Iterate Through Each Character**: For each character in the string:\n   - If the character is an opening bracket `[`, we increment the `balance`.\n   - If the character is a closing bracket `]`, we decrement the `balance` but ensure it doesn't go below 0 to avoid invalid sequences.\n   - After each update to `balance`, we check if it exceeds `max_balance` and update `max_balance` accordingly.\n\n3. **Check for Nesting**: During each iteration, if `max_balance` reaches 2 or more, it indicates that there is a nested subsequence, and we immediately return `true`.\n\n4. **Return Result**: If the loop completes without finding a nested subsequence, we return `false`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for nesting in a single pass through the string, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_nested(s):\n    balance = 0\n    max_balance = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '[':\n            balance += 1\n            if balance > max_balance:\n                max_balance = balance\n        elif char == ']':\n            if balance > 0:\n                balance -= 1\n        if max_balance >= 2:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe provided Python function `is_nested` efficiently determines if there's a valid nested subsequence of square brackets in the input string. By maintaining a balance counter and tracking the maximum depth of brackets encountered, the function can quickly identify if nesting occurs.

This formula works because the average of a sequence of consecutive integers is the average of the first and last term.\n3. **Round Down the Average**: Using Python's `math.floor()` function, we round down the computed average to the nearest integer.\n4. **Convert to Binary**: Convert the rounded average to its binary string representation using Python's `bin()` function and slice off the '0b' prefix to get the binary digits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\n    if n > m:\n        return \"-1\"\n    avg = (n + m) / 2\n    rounded = math.floor(avg)\n    return bin(rounded)[2:]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Check for Valid Range**: The function first checks if `n` is greater than `m`. If true, it returns \"-1\".\n2. **Compute the Average**: The average is computed using integer division, which inherently floors the result for positive integers.\n3. **Round Down the Average**: The `math.floor()` function ensures that the average is rounded down to the nearest integer.\n4. **Convert to Binary**: The `bin()` function converts the integer to a binary string, and slicing `[2:]` removes the '0b' prefix to return the binary digits as a string.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging integer division for flooring and built-in functions for binary conversion, ensuring correctness and performance."}

It initializes two flags, `increasing` and `decreasing`, to track the possible trends. As it iterates through the list, it updates these flags based on the comparison of consecutive elements. If both flags are set to false at any point, the function returns false immediately. If the loop completes, the function returns true if either flag is still true, indicating the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.\n\n### C++ Solution\n```cpp\n#include <vector>\nusing namespace std;\n\nbool monotonic(vector<float> l) {\n    bool increasing = true;\n    bool decreasing = true;\n    for (int i = 0; i < l.size() - 1; ++i) {\n        if (l[i] < l[i+1]) {\n            decreasing = false;\n        } else if (l[i] > l[i+1]) {\n            increasing = false;\n        }\n        if (!increasing && !decreasing) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return increasing || decreasing;\n}\n```\n\nThis C++ function follows the same logic as the Python solution. It initializes the flags and iterates through the vector, updating the flags based on the comparison of consecutive elements. If both flags are false, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true if either flag remains true after the loop.", "py_summary": "\n\nTo determine if a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, the provided Python function uses a straightforward approach with two boolean flags to track the possible trends. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The function starts by setting two flags, `increasing` and `decreasing`, both to `True`. These flags help track whether the list could be increasing or decreasing as we iterate through it.\n\n2. **Iteration**: The function iterates through the list, comparing each element with the next one.\n   - If an element is less than the next (`lst[i] < lst[i + 1]`), it sets `decreasing` to `False` because the list cannot be decreasing if at least one pair is increasing.\n   - If an element is greater than the next (`lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`), it sets `increasing` to `False` because the list cannot be increasing if at least one pair is decreasing.\n\n3. **Early Termination**: If both flags (`increasing` and `decreasing`) become `False` during the iteration, the function immediately returns `False`. This indicates that the list is neither entirely increasing nor decreasing.\n\n4. **Final Check**: After completing the iteration, the function checks the state of the flags. If either `increasing` or `decreasing` is still `True`, it returns `True`, indicating the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, respectively.\n\nThis method ensures that the function efficiently determines the monotonic nature of the list in a single pass, making it both time and space efficient."}

Using `''.join(strings)`, it concatenates all strings in the list into a single string. If the input list is empty, `join()` returns an empty string, which is the desired behavior.\n\n- **C++ Solution**: The function `concatenate` initializes an empty string `result`. It then iterates over each string in the input vector, appending each string to `result`. This approach ensures that all strings are concatenated efficiently. If the input vector is empty, the loop does not execute, and an empty string is returned.\n\nBoth solutions efficiently handle the concatenation of strings, ensuring correct results for both empty and non-empty input vectors.", "py_summary": "\n\nThe Python code provided for the problem of concatenating a vector of strings into a single string is both efficient and straightforward. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the code:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `concatenate` is defined to take a single parameter `strings`, which is a list of strings.\n\n2. **String Concatenation Using `join` Method**: The function uses `''.join(strings)` to concatenate all the strings in the input list. The `join` method is called on an empty string `''`, which acts as the separator between the elements of the list. Since the separator is an empty string, the elements are joined without any additional characters in between.\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: \n   - **Empty List**: If the input list `strings` is empty, the `join` method will return an empty string `''`, which is the expected behavior as demonstrated in the example `concatenate({})` returning `\"\"`.\n   - **Single Element List**: If the list contains only one string, the `join` method will return that string as is.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The `join` method is highly efficient in Python, especially for large lists, because it is implemented in C, which is faster than a loop written in pure Python. This makes the function perform well even with large datasets.\n\n5. **Readability and Simplicity**: The solution is concise and easy to understand. It avoids unnecessary loops or complex logic, making it maintainable and less error-prone.\n\n6. **Comparison with C++ Solution**: The C++ solution provided uses a similar approach by initializing an empty string and iterating over each string in the input vector to build the result. While the syntax and some implementation details differ, the overall logic of concatenating strings efficiently is consistent between the two solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, the Python code effectively solves the problem with a clear, efficient, and readable implementation that handles all specified cases appropriately."}

By slicing the string starting from the third character (`[2:]`), we obtain the binary representation without the prefix.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion and ensures that the result is returned as a binary string, correctly handling edge cases such as \\( N = 0 \\)."}

Sorting is essential because it brings any two numbers that are close to each other next to each other in the list. This reduces the problem of finding close elements to simply checking adjacent pairs.\n\n3. **Iterating Through the Sorted List**:\n   - A `for` loop is used to iterate through the sorted list starting from the second element (index 1) up to the last element. This loop compares each element with its predecessor to check if their difference is within the threshold.\n\n4. **Checking Adjacent Pairs**:\n   - Inside the loop, the difference between the current element (`numbers[i]`) and the previous element (`numbers[i-1]`) is calculated. If this difference is less than or equal to the threshold, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that at least one pair of numbers is closer than the specified threshold.\n\n5. **Returning the Result**:\n   - If the loop completes without finding any pair of numbers within the threshold, the function returns `False`, indicating that no two numbers in the list are closer than the specified threshold.\n\n6. **Efficiency Considerations**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: The sorting step takes \\(O(n \\log n)\\) time, where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the list. The subsequent loop runs in \\(O(n)\\) time. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is \\(O(n \\log n)\\), which is efficient for large datasets.\n   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \\(O(1)\\) since no additional data structures are used beyond the input list and a few variables.\n\n7. **Edge Cases and Considerations**:\n   - **Duplicate Numbers**: If the list contains duplicate numbers, their difference is zero, which is always less than any positive threshold. The code correctly handles this by returning `True`.\n   - **Minimum List Size**: The problem guarantees that the list has at least two elements, so no special handling is needed for smaller lists.\n\n8. **Correctness**:\n   - By sorting the list and checking only adjacent elements, the function ensures that the closest pair of numbers is found efficiently. This approach is both optimal and correct for the given problem constraints.\n\nIn conclusion, the Python code efficiently and correctly determines if any two numbers in the list are closer than the specified threshold by leveraging sorting and a linear scan, resulting in an optimal solution with a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\)."}

Here's a detailed analysis of how the code works:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The function `parse_music` takes a single string argument `music_string`, which contains musical notes separated by spaces.\n\n2. **Splitting the String**: The string is split into individual note strings using the `split()` method.

This is optimal for the given problem.\n\n**Potential Improvements**:\n- **Error Handling**: The current implementation does not handle invalid or unrecognized notes. Adding checks to manage such cases could improve robustness.\n- **Extensibility**: If additional note types are introduced in the future, the conditional checks can be extended to accommodate them.\n\nOverall, the code is clear, concise, and effectively solves the problem by mapping each note to its corresponding beat duration through straightforward string operations and conditional checks."}

This builds all prefixes from length 1 to the full length of the string.\n- **C++ Code**: The function `all_prefixes` initializes an empty vector `result`. It iterates over each character index of the input string `str`. For each index `i`, it uses `substr(0, i + 1)` to get the prefix and adds it to `result`.

This list is crucial as it determines the positions of the planets.\n\n2. **Input Validation**: The function checks if both input planets (`planet1` and `planet2`) are present in the `ordered_planets` list. If either is missing, it returns an empty list, adhering to the problem's requirement to handle invalid inputs.\n\n3. **Index Retrieval**: Using the `index()` method, the function finds the positions (indices) of `planet1` and `planet2` within the `ordered_planets` list. These indices represent their order from the Sun.\n\n4. **Range Determination**: The function calculates the `lower` and `higher` indices using `min()` and `max()` functions. This step ensures that the correct range between the two planets is identified, regardless of their order in the input.\n\n5. **Slicing the List**: The function returns a slice of the `ordered_planets` list, starting just after the `lower` index and ending before the `higher` index. This slice includes all planets between the two input planets, excluding the inputs themselves.\n\n6. **Edge Cases Handling**: The code correctly handles scenarios where the input planets are the same, adjacent, or at the extremes of the list, ensuring the output is always accurate.\n\n7. **Efficiency**: Given the small size of the `ordered_planets` list (only 8 elements), the operations are efficient, with time complexity being O(n) for list operations, where n is small and manageable.\n\n8. **Code Clarity**: The code is clear and concise, with descriptive variable names that make the logic easy to follow. This enhances maintainability and understanding for anyone reviewing the code.\n\nIn summary, the Python code effectively solves the problem by leveraging the predefined order of planets, efficiently handling input validation, and correctly slicing the list to return the desired output."}

These are the numbers that need to be replaced with even numbers from `lst2`.\n2. **Count Even Numbers in `lst2`:** Next, we count how many even numbers are present in `lst2`. These are the potential candidates to replace the odd numbers in `lst1`.\n3. **Calculate Total Even Numbers:** We then calculate the total number of even numbers available in both `lst1` and `lst2`. This gives us the total pool of even numbers that can be used to replace the odd numbers in `lst1`.\n4. **Check Conditions:** Finally, we check two conditions:\n   - The total number of even numbers must be at least equal to the length of `lst1` to ensure we can replace all elements in `lst1` with even numbers.\n   - The number of even numbers in `lst2` must be at least equal to the number of odd numbers in `lst1` to ensure we can replace all odd numbers in `lst1`.\n\nIf both conditions are satisfied, it is possible to perform the exchange; otherwise, it is not.\n\n### Solution Code\n"}

If it is, the function immediately returns an empty dictionary `{}`.\n\n3. **Splitting the String**:\n   - If the input string is not empty, it splits the string into a list of words using the `split()` method. This creates a list where each element is a string representing a single character from the input.\n\n4. **Counting Character Occurrences**:\n   - An empty dictionary `counts` is initialized to keep track of the frequency of each character.\n   - The function then iterates over each character in the list obtained from splitting the string.\n   - For each character, it uses the dictionary's `get` method to retrieve the current count of that character (defaulting to 0 if the character hasn't been counted yet) and increments it by 1.\n\n5. **Determining the Maximum Count**:\n   - After counting all characters, the function calculates the maximum frequency of any character using `max(counts.values())`. This gives the highest number of repetitions for any single character in the input string.\n\n6. **Constructing the Result**:\n   - The function initializes an empty dictionary `result` to store the final output.\n   - It then iterates over each key-value pair in the `counts` dictionary. If the value (i.e., the count) of a character equals the `max_count`, that character and its count are added to the `result` dictionary.\n\n7. **Returning the Result**:\n   - Finally, the function returns the `result` dictionary, which contains all characters that have the highest repetition count in the input string.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts character occurrences and identifies those with the highest frequency, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal."}
