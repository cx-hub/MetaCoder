It then uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the numbers that have a count of 1 or less. This effectively removes all duplicates from the original list.\n3. The resulting list is returned by the function.\n\nThe key benefits of this approach are:\n\n* It preserves the original order of the elements, as required by the problem statement.\n* It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because it only needs to iterate over the list once to count the occurrences of each number.\n\nOverall, the Python code provides a concise and efficient solution to the problem of removing duplicates from a list while preserving the original order."}

It then creates a dictionary `vowels_replace` that maps each vowel to the letter that appears 2 places ahead of it in the English alphabet. This is done using a dictionary comprehension and the `ord` function, which returns the ASCII value of a character, and the `chr` function, which returns the character represented by a specific ASCII value.\n3. The `swapcase` method is used to swap the case of all letters in the input message.\n4. Finally, a list comprehension is used to iterate over each character in the message.

The `math.ceil` function is used to calculate the ceiling of the division of the total water in each well by the bucket capacity. This gives the minimum number of times the bucket needs to be lowered to empty each well.\n3. The list comprehension `[math.ceil(sum(arr)/capacity) for arr in grid]` applies this calculation to each well in the grid, resulting in a list of the minimum number of bucket lowers needed for each well.\n4. The outer `sum` function adds up these values to give the total minimum number of bucket lowers needed to empty all the wells.\n\nOverall, the code uses a concise and efficient approach to calculate the minimum number of bucket lowers needed to empty the wells, taking into account the bucket capacity and the amount of water in each well."}

The `digits_sum` function converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts it back to an integer, and sums up all the digits.\n3. The `order_by_points` function uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the input list of integers. The `key` argument of the `sorted` function is set to the `digits_sum` function, which means that the sorting will be based on the sum of the digits of each integer.\n4. The `sorted` function returns a new list with the integers sorted in ascending order based on the sum of their digits. If two integers have the same sum of digits, their original order is preserved because the `sorted` function is stable.\n\nOverall, the code provides a concise and efficient solution to the problem of sorting a list of integers based on the sum of their digits."}

Two lists are defined: `num` and `sym`. `num` contains the decimal values of the Roman numerals, and `sym` contains the corresponding Roman numeral symbols.\n2. The code starts from the largest decimal value (1000) and iterates downwards.\n3. For each decimal value, the code calculates how many times it can be subtracted from the input number without going below 0. This is done using the `//` operator, which performs integer division.\n4. The corresponding Roman numeral symbol is appended to the result string as many times as the decimal value was subtracted from the input number.\n5. The input number is updated by taking the remainder of the division using the `%` operator.\n6. Steps 3-5 are repeated until the input number becomes 0.\n7. Finally, the result string is converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method and returned.\n\nThe code uses a simple and efficient approach to convert integers to Roman numerals, taking advantage of the fact that Roman numerals are based on a subtractive notation."}
